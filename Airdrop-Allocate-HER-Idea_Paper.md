# Airdrop Allocate-HER: Full Idea Paper

## Overview

Airdrop Allocate-HER tackles gender disparity in crypto airdrops by creating a registry of women-owned wallets verified through @selfprotocol using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Verified users receive boosted airdrop allocations while maintaining privacy and control over personal identity data.

---

## Problem

Crypto airdrops are largely claimed by male-dominated user bases. Studies suggest that <1% of airdrops reach women. Most airdrops rely on interaction data alone, ignoring the lack of diversity in distribution.

---

## Solution

The proposed system uses @selfprotocol to verify wallet ownership and gender using privacy-preserving zkPassport scans. Verified users are added to a registry managed by a smart contract, which integrates with airdrop partners to enable bonus allocations.

---

## How It Works

1. Connect wallet via UI
2. Initiate gender verification using @selfprotocol
3. zkPassport proof validates identity privately
4. Smart contract logs verified wallet in the registry
5. Supported protocols allocate enhanced airdrops to registry members

---

## Architecture

### Frontend
- React + Tailwind
- Wallet Connect + Onboarding Flow

### Backend
- Smart contract (Solidity)
- Registry + airdrop allocation logic
- Layer 2 (Optimism) deployment

### Identity Layer
- zkPassport via @selfprotocol
- Zero-knowledge gender proof
- No sensitive data stored on-chain

---

## Challenges

- Adoption: UX must be intuitive for non-technical users
- Verification Abuse: Fake passport checks
- Regulation: Legal compliance for ID verification
- Scalability: Growing registry, cross-chain future

---

## Security & Privacy

- ZKPs protect identity
- Smart contracts must be audited
- No PII stored on-chain

---

## Future Plans

- Incentive model for protocols integrating the registry
- Onboarding tools for female-led DAOs
- Multichain registry support

---

## Conclusion

Airdrop Allocate-HER uses cutting-edge blockchain tech for equity and privacy. With a strong UX and trusted ZK verification, it can reshape cryptoâ€™s airdrop game.
