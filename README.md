# Airdrop Allocate-HER

**A privacy-preserving, inclusive airdrop registry for women in crypto.**

Airdrop Allocate-HER is a decentralized identity-verified airdrop distribution system focused on improving the share of airdrops received by women in the crypto space — without compromising privacy.

Powered by @selfprotocol and zero-knowledge proofs, it allows users to verify their gender and register their wallets for boosted airdrops, all while maintaining full control of their identity.

## 🔍 Purpose

Less than 1% of crypto airdrops reportedly reach women. This project addresses that imbalance through:
- ✅ Zero-knowledge gender verification
- ✅ Decentralized wallet registry
- ✅ Boosted airdrop eligibility

---

## 🛠 Features

- ZK-based identity verification via `@selfprotocol`
- Smart contract-managed airdrop allocations
- Integration-ready with Web3 projects (DeFi, DAOs, NFTs)
- Layer 2 (Optimism) support for gas efficiency

---

## 🧩 Architecture

- Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
- Smart Contracts: Solidity (L2 Optimism)
- Identity Proofs: zkPassport by @selfprotocol
- Off-chain storage: IPFS (non-sensitive logs)
